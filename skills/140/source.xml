What is it?</tex>

 For a binary operation $*$ defined as $a*b$ where \underline\text{both} $a,b\in A$, $b$ is \underline\text{inverse of $a$} if
\[ \qquad \qquad a * b = e = b * a \]
 where $e\in A$ is the \underline\text{identity element}
 Notice that every $a$ will have it's own inverse $b$ even though the $e$ is the same for all $a$ 
 And it is possible that there is no inverse for some $a\in A$
 For example, for $A = \left\lbrace -1,1,-2,2,3 \right\rbrace$ and a binary operator $*$ defined as $a*b = a + b$
\[ \qquad e = 0\text{ because } a * e = e * a = a \]
 Hence, one would think that the \underline\text{inverse} of $a=3$ would be $b = a^{-1} = -3$ 
 But $-3\notin A$. And therefore $a=3$ has no inverse for $a=3$ in $A$%
