What they are ; Finding a point, tangent or normal on the curve</tex>

 Ordinarily, we expect curves to be of the form $y = f(x)$ 
 But if both $x$ and $y$ are expressed in terms of a third variable/parameter, then we have what is called a \underline\text{parametric curve}
 And therefore, \underline\text{instead of one} $y = f(x)$ type equation, \underline\text{we will have two equations} -- both in terms of the parameter $(t)$
\[ \quad x = f(t)  \text{ and }  y = g(t) \]
 The curve is still plotted in $x-y$. It is only expressed in terms of $t$
 \textbf{Coordinates of a point $A$ }
 A point $A$ on the curve will have the coordinates
\[ \qquad A = (x,y) = \left(f(t), g(t) \right)\]
 \textbf{Slope of the tangent at $A$}
 The slope of the tangent will continue to be $\dfrac{dy}{dx }$. However,
\[ \qquad\qquad \dfrac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy / dt}{dx / dt}\]
