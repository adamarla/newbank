 What does the graph of $y=x^2$ look like? How about $y = x^2$? What will $\left(\vec{a} + \vec{b} \right)$ look like? 
 The ability to create a picture from the facts given in the question will make it easier for you to understand and solve the problem. This is a especially useful skill to have when solving problems on calculus, coordinate geometry \&amp; vector algebra.%
