 When a function is defined differently in different regions of it's domain, we say that the function is  defined in pieces - or \underline\text{piece-wise defined}
 For example, $f(x) = \vert x\vert$ is defined as
%
\[ \qquad f(x) = \begin{cases}

-x, x &lt; 0 \\
x, x\geq 0
\end{cases} \]
%text
 Notice, the different definitions of $f(x)$ for $x\geq 0$ and $x &lt;  0$%
