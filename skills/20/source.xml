Getting $r$ heads in $n$ coin flips</tex>
  </render>
  <reason>
    <tex>%text
 Imagine a task (like flipping a coin) that could either be a success (getting heads) or a failure (getting tails)
 If this task is done $n$ times, then what is the probability of getting $r$ successes?
 If we were to write the probabilities out, then we would get a table like the one below
%
\begin{align}
\begin{tabular}{NNNNN}

\hline
r &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \ldots &amp; n \\
\hline
P(r) &amp; p_0 &amp; p_1 &amp; \ldots &amp; p_n \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{align}
%text
 Notice that this is simply a probability distribution. But it goes by a special name -- binomial distribution 
 That said, $P(r)$ in the table above is
\[P(r) = ^nC_r\cdot p^r\cdot q^{(n-r)} \text{ where } q = 1- p \]
