 \textbf{Definition } A differential equation relates a function with its derivatives
\[ 3\left(\frac{d^2y }{dx^2}\right)^{37} - \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{100} + x = 0\]
 is, for example, a differential equation 
 It is also an \underline\text{ordinary} differential equation because it has only $y', y''$ type terms 
 \textbf{Order} The order of a differential equation is the order of the \underline\text{highest order} derivative in the equation For example, $3\left(\frac{d^2y }{dx^2}\right)^{37} - \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{100} + x = 0$ has \underline\text{order} equal to 2 because of $\left(\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\right)$
 \textbf{Degree} The degree of a differential equation is the \underline\text{highest power} of the \underline\text{highest} order derivative in the equation
 For example, $3\left(\frac{d^2y }{dx^2}\right)^{37} - \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{100} + x = 0$  has \underline\text{degree} equal to 37 
 \textbf{Degrees are not always defined!} A degree is only defined for differential equations that are \underline\text{polynomial } in $y,y',y"$ etc.%
