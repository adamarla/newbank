Finding the intersection angles given the slopes of two lines; Condition for perpendicularity</tex>

 In the figure below, two lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ intersect
 Notice the triangle that has the $x-$axis as it's base. The three \underline\text{interior angles} of this triangle are
\[\qquad \underbrace{\phi_2}_P,\underbrace{\pi-\phi_1}_Q\text{ and } \underbrace{B = \phi_1-\phi_2}_{\pi - (P+Q)} \]

%text
 Both $A$ and $B$ are angles of intersection
 However, \underline\text{by convention}, we report the angle of intersection as $\theta \leq 90^\circ$ 
 Which means $\theta = \tan^{-1}\left\vert \dfrac{m_1 - m_2}{1+m_1\cdot m_2}\right\vert$ 
 Also, if $\theta=90^\circ$, then $\tan\theta = \infty$. Or
\[ 1 + m_1\cdot m_2 = 0 \implies \underbrace{m_1\cdot m_2 = -1}_{\text{Condition for orthogonality}} \]
