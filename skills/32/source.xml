 In Math, you can change how something looks as long you don't change its value. For example
%
\begin{align}

\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\sin x}{1+\sin x}} &amp;= \dfrac{\sqrt{1-\sin x}}{\sqrt{1+\sin x}}\times\dfrac{\sqrt{1+\sin x}}{\sqrt{1+\sin x}} \\
&amp;= \dfrac{\sqrt{1-\sin^2 x}}{\sqrt{\left(1+\sin x \right)^2}} = \dfrac{\cos x}{1+\sin x}
\end{align}

 And sometimes changing how an expression looks makes it easier to work with 
 Hence, if you see something that looks big \&amp; complicated or looks like something you need (but not exactly), then you should look for ways of simplifying the expression
 There are no rules. You will just have to be creative!%
