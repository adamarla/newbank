    <tex>\title{Identifying differential equation type}
Is it ordinary, homogenous or first-order linear</tex>
  </render>
  <reason>
    <tex>%text
 At school level, you will be asked to solve only the following types of differential equations
%
\begin{align}
\begin{tabular}{cN}

\hline
\text{Type} &amp; \text{Looks like} \\
\hline
\text{Ordinary} &amp; \dydx = g(x)\cdot h(y) \\
\hline
\text{Homogenous} &amp; \dydx = f \left(\frac{y}{x} \right) \\
\hline
\text{First order linear} &amp; \dydx + P(x)\cdot y = Q(x) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{align}
%text
 Notice that all of the above differential equations have \underline\text{order one and degree one}
 Each of the above equations has a different technique for solving it. Hence, one must first identify the type of the differential equation%
