 Sometimes you will have to find the equation of a line given its slope, points it passes through etc 
 And at other times, you will have to do the opposite 
 You will be \underline\text{given the equation} of a line and you will have to figure out the line's slope, where it intersects with another line, it's $x-$ and $y-$ intercepts etc 
 So, given a line $L_1: ax + by + c = 0$, re-write it as
\[ \qquad y = -\frac{a}{b} x - \frac{c}{b}\]

\begin{align}
\begin{tabular}{cNN}

\hline
&amp; \text{Value}  &amp; \text{How?} \\
\hline
Slope &amp; m = -\frac{a}{b} &amp; y = mx + c \\
\hline
$x$-intercept &amp; -\frac{c}{a} &amp; \text{Put }y = 0 \\
\hline
$y$-intercept &amp; -\frac{c}{b} &amp; \text{Put } x= 0 \\
\hline
Point of intersection &amp; &amp; \text{Solve } y = m_1 x + c_1 \\
&amp; &amp; = m_2 x + c_2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{align}
