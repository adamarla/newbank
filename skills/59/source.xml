Understanding \&amp; working with sets expressed in either of the two forms</tex>
  </render>
  <reason>

 There are two ways of expressing sets 
 Either one can write out all the elements that are in the set. This is the \underline\text{roster form} -- from the English word 'roster'
 For example, below is the set of positive even integers less than 10
\[ \quad E = \left\lbrace 2,4,6,8 \right\rbrace\]
 Alternatively, one can write the \underline\text{recipe} for how the set is built. This is called the \underline\text{set-builder} form. For example, the above set can also be written as
\[ \quad E = \left\lbrace x : x = 2k,\, 1\leq k &lt; 5, k\in\mathbb{Z} \right\rbrace\]
 It is the \underline\text{same set, written differently}%
