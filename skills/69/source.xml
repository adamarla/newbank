Given the equations of two curves</tex>
  </render>
  <reason>
    <tex>%text
 In coordinate geometry, every gemoetrical shape or curve is represented by an equation 
 Hence, if one wants to find the points of intersection of two curves $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, then one simply needs to find the $x$'s for which $f(x) = g(x)$ -- and then the corresponding $y$'s 
 Or, you can find the $y$'s first and then the $x$'s. It is all the same 
 The following is what you will need to do
%
\begin{align}

y &amp;= f(x) = g(x) \implies x = \left\lbrace x_1, x_2, \ldots\right\rbrace
\end{align}
%text
 And hence, the points of intersection are
\[ \qquad \underbrace{\left\lbrace\left(x_1, f(x_1) \right), \left(x_2, f(x_2) \right)\ldots\right\rbrace}_{\text{or }\left(x,g(x) \right).\text{ Either is fine}} \]
