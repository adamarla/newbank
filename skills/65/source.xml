 A circle is the locus of all points that are equi-distant from a given point (known as the center) 
 The figure above shows a circle whose center is at the origin $O$
 It does not have to be though. The center can be at any point $(a,b)$
 The \underline\text{standard equation} of a circle with center at $(a,b)$ and radius $R$   is
\[ \qquad \left(x-a \right)^2 + \left(y-b \right)^2 = R^2 \]
 When the center is at the origin, that is $(a,b) = (0,0)$, then this boils down to
\[ \qquad x^2 + y^2 = R^2 \]
