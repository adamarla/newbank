         Counting outcomes by listing them first instead of using 
         $\permi{n}{r}$ or $\combi{n}{r}

 If the number of possible outcomes is small, then it just might be easier to list them out first and count 
 For example, the following is a good use-case for this approach
 \textit{In how many ways can one roll a total of $7$ using two dice?}
 But the following is perhaps not 
 \textit{In how many ways is the following possible?}
\[ \qquad a + b + c = 100\quad \left(a,b,c,\in\mathbb{N} \right)\]
 The number of potential outcomes is too large for one to count them all quickly and reliably by listing them out first%
