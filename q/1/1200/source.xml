Assume that the chances of a patient
having a heart attack is $40\%$. Assuming
that a meditation and yoga course reduces 
the risk of a heart attack by $30\%$ and
prescription of certain drugs reduces its
chances by $25\%$. At a time, a patient can 
choose any of the two options with equal 
probabilities\newline 

It is given that after going 
through one of the two options, a patient 
selected at random suffers a heart attack\newline 

Find the probability that the patient followed
a course of meditation and yoga. Interpret
the result and state which of the above
methods is beneficial for the patient

Yoga and the drug \underline{reduce} the chances of having a heart-attack by $30\%$ and $25\%$ respectively -- not bring it down to $30\%$ and $25\%$\newline 

Hence, for the given events $H,Y$ and $D$

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{NlN}

        \text{Event} &amp; Meaning &amp; \text{Probability} \\

From Bayes' Theorem, we know that
\smallmath
\begin{align}
	\condp{Y}{H} &amp;= \frac{\condp{H}{Y}\cdot P(Y)}{\underbrace{\condp{H}{Y}\cdot P(Y) + \condp{H}{D}\cdot P(D)}_{\text{Probability of heart-attack if Yoga or Drug}}} \\
	\text{where } P(H) &amp;= P(D) = 0.5 \\
	\therefore \condp{Y}{H} &amp;= \underbrace{\frac{\condp{H}{Y}}{\condp{H}{Y} + \condp{H}{D}}}_{P(H) \text{ and } P(D)\text{ cancel out}} \\
	&amp;= \frac{0.28}{0.28 + 0.3} = \frac{14}{29} \\
	\text{and } \condp{D}{H} &amp;= \underbrace{1 - \condp{Y}{H} = \frac{15}{29}}_{\text{One of yoga or drug option taken}}
\end{align} 


Note that $40\%$ was the probability of having a heart-attack \underline{without} yoga or  the drug \newline 

But we know that this person was either doing yoga or taking the drug. And still he had a heart-attack \newline 

Which is why 

\begin{itemize}
\item{The $P(H)$ we need now is the probability of a heart-attack \underline{given} yoga or the drug} 
\item{ $\condp{Y}{H} + \condp{D}{H} = 1$} 
\end{itemize}

As $\condp{Y}{H} &lt; \condp{D}{H}$, the person would have been better off taking the drug

We know that the person has had a heart-attack \newline 

We also know that he was \underline{less likely} to have been doing Yoga and \underline{more likely} to have taken the drug \newline 

Which means, he is more likely to have made a bad decision (taking the drug) \newline 

Which means, doing Yoga was the better option</tex>
