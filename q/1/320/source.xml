It is standard practice to take a chest
\xray of a person suspected of having 
tuberculosis $(TB)$. The probability of 
detecting $TB$ in a person actually suffering
from it is $\frac{99}{100}$. However, the probability 
of a healthy person being diagnosed with 
$TB$ is $\xntb$\newline 

In a certain city, 1 in 600 people suffers from $TB$. A person is selected 
at random and is diagnosed with $TB$. What is the probability that the person 
actually has the disease?

 The \xray is a \underline\text{seemingly reliable} way to detect $TB$. But it is obviously not perfect
\[ \qquad \underbrace{\condp{X}{TB} = \xtb}_{\text{\xray says $TB$ and the person actually has $TB$}}\]
 As we have been told, it is entirely possible that the \xray says a person has $TB$ when he actually does not
\[ \qquad \underbrace{\condp{X}{\overline{TB}}= \xntb}_{\text{\xray says $TB$ for a healthy person}} \]
 Moreover, in this town, 1 in every 600 people has $TB$
\[ \qquad \therefore \prob{TB} = \frac{1}{600} \]
 And what we would like to know is that \underline\text{if the \xray says $TB$} then does the person \underline\text{actually have it}
\[ \qquad \condp{TB}{X} = ? \]

 From Bayes' Theorem, we know that
%
\begin{align}

\condp{TB}{X} &amp;= \fcondp{TB}{X} \\
\text{where } \prob{X} &amp;= \condp{X}{TB}\prob{TB} \\
&amp;+ \condp{X}{\overline{TB}}\prob{\overline{TB}} \\
&amp;= \underbrace{\xtb\cdot\frac{1}{600} + \xntb\cdot\frac{599}{600}}_{\text{Rule of Total Probability}} \\
&amp;= \left[ \frac{6381}{600\times 1000}\right] \\
\therefore \condp{TB}{X} &amp;= \dfrac{\xtb\cdot\frac{1}{600}}{\frac{6381}{600\cdot 1000}} = \frac{990}{6381} = \frac{110}{709}
\end{align}

 This is a surprisingly low number. If a person is known to have $TB$, then there is a $99\%$ chance that his \xray will confirm the disease 
 But, the converse is not true. If a person's \xray shows $TB$, then there is only about a $15.6\% = \frac{110}{709}$ chance that he actually does have $TB$%
