  <statement>
    <tex>$40\%$ students of a college reside in hostel
      and the remaining reside outside. At the
      end of the year, $50\%$ of the hostlers got
      \agrade while from outside students, only
      $30\%$ got \agrade in the examination.
      At the end of the year, a student of the
      college was chosen at random and was
      found to have gotten \agrade\newline
      
      What is the probability that the selected
      student was a hostler?</tex>

 $40\%$ of the students are hostlers. Therefore $\prob{H} = 0.4$ 
 A student is either a hostler or is not. Hence $\prob{H'} = 1-\prob{H} = 0.6$ 
 If the student is a hostler, then there is a $50\%$ chance that he would get an \agrade $\implies \condp{A}{H} = 0.5$ 
 But if he is not a hostler, then there is a $30\%$ chance that he would get an \agrade $\implies \condp{A}{H'} =0.3$ 
 Which is why
%
\begin{align}
\begin{tabular}{NlN}

\hline
\text{Expression} &amp; \text{Meaning} &amp; \text{Value} \\
\hline
\prob{H} &amp; \text{Is a hostler} &amp; 0.4 \\
\hline
\condp{A}{H}&amp;\agrade\text{ given hostler} &amp; 0.5 \\
\hline
\condp{A}{H'} &amp;\agrade\text{ given not hostler} &amp; 0.3 \\
\hline
\prob{H'} &amp; \text{Not a hostler} &amp; 0.6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{align}

 But what we \underline\text{want to know} is the probability that a student is a hostler \underline\text{given that} he has got an \agrade, that is,
\[ \qquad \qquad \condp{H}{A} = ? \]

 From Bayes' Theorem, we know that
%
\begin{align}

\condp{H}{A} &amp;= \dfrac{\prob{H\cap A}}{\prob{A}} \\
&amp;= \underbrace{\fcondp{H}{A}}_{\text{Bayes' Theorem}}
\end{align}
%text
 Where
\[\underbrace{\prob{A} = \condp{A}{H}\prob{H} + \condp{A}{H'}\prob{H'}}_{\text{Theorem of Total Probability}} \]
 And therefore
%
\begin{align}

\condp{H}{A} &amp;= \dfrac{\frac{5}{10}\cdot\frac{4}{10}}
{\frac{5}{10}\cdot\frac{4}{10} + \frac{3}{10}\cdot\frac{6}{10} } = \dfrac{10}{19}
