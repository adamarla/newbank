 For $B$ to win, $A$ should \underline\text{not} already have won the game by getting a number $&gt; 4$
 Hence, for $B$ to win \underline\text{in the $N-$th round}, no one should have won in the \underline\text{preceding} $N-1$ rounds

%
\begin{align}
\begin{tabular}{cN}

\hline
\text{Event} &amp; \text{Probability} \\
\hline
\text{Single dice roll $&gt; 4$} &amp; \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \\
\hline
\text{Single dice roll $\leq 4$} &amp; 1-\frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \\
\hline
\text{No one wins in a round} &amp; \frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{2}{3} = \nextrd\\

\text{$B$ wins in a round} &amp; \underbrace{\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{3} = \bwins}_{\text{$A$ doesn't win but $B$ does}} \\

 The probability that $B$ wins is therefore
\[ \qquad P = \sum_{N=1}^\infty \left(\nextrd \right)^{N-1}\cdot\bwins = \frac{2}{5} \]

      <reason>
        <tex>%text
 $B$ could win in the $1-$st round or the $100-$th round or the $1000-$th round. Hence, the \underline\text{total probability} of $B$ winning is
%
\begin{align}

P &amp;= \expa^0\bwins + \expa^1\bwins + \expa^2\bwins + \cdots \infty \\
&amp;= \sum_{N=1}^\infty\expa^{N-1}\cdot\bwins \\
&amp;= \bwins \left[\dfrac{1}{1-\nextrd} \right] = \bwins\cdot\frac{9}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\end{align}
%text
 Notice that $B$ only has a $40\%$ chance of winning compared to $A$'s $60\%$ simply because $A$ rolls first%
