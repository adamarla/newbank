 At a given time $t$, the position of a particle is given by $(x,y) = \left(t, \log t \right)$
 This particle is accelerating along the $x-$axis%

  <reason>
    <tex>%text
 The \underline\text{speed} of the particle \underline\text{along the $x-$axis} is given by \[\quad s_x = \frac{d}{dt} x = \frac{d}{dt} t = 1\] It's acceleration, however, is
\[ \quad a_x = \frac{d}{dt} s_x  = 0 \]
 Hence, the particle is \underline\text{not} accelerating along the $x-$axis. In fact, its speed (along $x-$axis) is constant%
