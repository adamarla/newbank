 The following differential equation
\[ \qquad x^3 \expa + x\expb = 0 \]
 is of \underline\text{order 3 and degree 4}%
</tex>

  <reason>
    <tex>%text
 $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ is the most $y$ has been differentiated with respect to $x$. Hence, the \underline\text{order} of the differential equation is $2$ 
 The degree of the equation \underline\text{will also} come from this highest-order differential term 
 Notice that in $\expa, \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}$ has been raised to the power $2$. Hence, the \underline\text{degree} is also $2$ 
 Every other term, like $\expb$, \underline\text{is irrelevant}%
