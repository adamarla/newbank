 A cube with sides 1m is filled with water, and has a tiny hole through which water drains into a cylinder of radius 1m
 If the water level in the cube is falling at the rate of 1 cm/s, then it rising in the cylinder at the rate of $\frac{1}\pi$ cm/s%

 The situation is as shown below

 The rate at which the \underline\text{cube loses} water is the same as the rate which the \underline\text{cylinder gains} water. And therefore
%
\begin{align}

L^2\cdot\frac{dh}{dt} &amp;= \pi R^2\cdot \frac{dH}{dt} \\
\left(1\text{m} \right)^2\cdot 1\cmps &amp;= \pi \left(1\text{m} \right)^2\cdot\frac{dH}{dt} \\
\therefore \frac{dH}{dt} &amp;= \frac{1}\pi\cmps
\end{align}
