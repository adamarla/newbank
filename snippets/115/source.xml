 A die is rolled three times. It gives a $5$ on the first roll and a $6$ on the second. The probability that it will give a $3$ or a $4$ on the third is therefore
\[ \qquad\qquad P = \frac{1}{2} \]

 A die has no memory. What it does on the third roll is independent of what it did in the first two
 Hence, the probability of getting a $3$ or a $4$ on the third roll is simply
\[ \qquad P = \dfrac{n\left\lbrace 3,4\right\rbrace}{n\left\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5,6\right\rbrace} = \dfrac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]
