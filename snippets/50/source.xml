 $f(x) = \fx$ is decreasing at $x=\dfrac{3\pi}{2}$%

 This is a trick question. For $f'(x)$ to be defined, $f(x)$ must also be defined at that point. But $f(x)$ is not defined at $x=\dfrac{3\pi}{2}$
 Here is why 
 $f(x) = \log \left(\tan\frac{x}{2} \right)$. Hence, $\tan\frac{x}{2} &gt; 0$ for $f(x)$ to be defined 
 But at $x = \frac{3\pi}{2}, \tan\frac{x}{2} = \tan\frac{3\pi}{4} &lt; 0$
 Hence, $f(x)$ is not defined. And therefore, neither is $f'(x)$
 The question of $f(x)$ increasing or decreasing at $x=\frac{3\pi}{2}$ therefore does not arise%
