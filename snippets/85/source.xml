 The degree of the differential equation \[\left(1+\dydx \right)^3 = \left(\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \right)^2\text{ is } 3\]%
</tex>

  <reason>
    <tex>%text
 Both the order and the degree come from the \underline\text{highest order} differential term
 The highest order differential is $\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2}$. And as we have $\left(\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2} \right)^2$, the \underline\text{degree} is $2$%
