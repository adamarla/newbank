\[ \qquad \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + \left(\dydx \right)^3 + 6y^5 = 0 \]
 is a differential equation of degree $1$%

  <reason>
    <tex>%text
 To find the degree (or order) of a differential equation, one must look at the \underline\text{most} differentiated term
 In this case, that is $\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2}$ 
 It is a second-order differential raised to the power of $1$
 Therefore, it's order is $2$ and \underline\text{degree} is $1$%
